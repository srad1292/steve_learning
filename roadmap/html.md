# HTML

[Table of Contents](../readme.md)

HTML is a markup language used to specify what will show up on a web page.  You can write HTML that you can open in your browser in anything as simple as notepad.  However, you will download VS Code which is a wonderful code editor.

Go to: <https://code.visualstudio.com/> and download.

Once you open VS Code, go to the extensions tab, and install some useful extensions: Auto Close Tag, Auto Rename Tag, Bracket Pair Colorizer 2, HTML Snippets.

Learning HTML:  
Go to: <https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp>  
Go through all the pages in the tutorial, forms, and graphics sections.  
As you read through the tutorials, write the HTML yourself using VS code and open them in the browser to see how they look.  You can play around with different elements and be a little creative as you learn.  
Note: to open, all you need to do is open the windows file explorer, find the html file, and double click.  Anytime you change something in the file, just refresh the browser and the content will be updated.
