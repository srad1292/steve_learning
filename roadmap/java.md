Get Eclipse: An IDE for Java - <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>

Open eclipse after installation and create a workspace called something like “learning-java”

Create a new java project by going to File -> New Java Project.  Call it something like “W3Code” and press the ‘Next Button’ and uncheck the ‘Create module-info.java’

In the package explorer, right click on the new project and find the option to create a new class. Call it HelloWorld for the name and check the public static void main stub option.

Inside the main method, type System.out.println(“Hello World”).  As you type, you will see one of the many nice things about using a code editor which is called autocompletion where you will see suggestions for System as you are typing it.  Once you type the period after the word System, you will see all of the methods and properties in the System class.  

Find the ‘Run’ button at the top of the editor and then press ‘Run’ within that menu.  You should see the ‘Hello World’ output.

System is capital because it is a class, out is lowercase because it is a property of System, println is lowercase because it is a method of the class PrintStream which is what out is an instance of. Move your cursor over the ‘System’ word, hold down ctrl and click on it.  This should take you to the System class. Here you can see the workings of the System class. Including finding the ‘out’ property.

Additional topics after code academy: Create new classes as needed for each of these topics to follow along with the information and to get used to using Eclipse.
