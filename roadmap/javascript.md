[Table of Contents](../readme.md)

Learning HTML:  
Go to: <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript>  
Go through all of the free sections  
  
Go to: <https://eloquentjavascript.net/>
This is a free to go through online version of the book  
Go through all of the chapters and read the text.  Anything you learned in code academy you can read through for supplemental learning. Anything that's new, you can code out along with the book for experience. When you get to this point where you are doing it yourself you can do one of two things depending on the complexity of what you are programming.  For simple things like seeing what 0.1 * 0.2 is in Javascript, you can use the developer console by using ctrl+shift+j while in a browser or opening it through the browser toolbar.  For more complex things, you can create an HTML file and use the "script" tag to load in a javascript file with your code.  This book also has you creating a simple platformer using canvas, which I think you will enjoy doing.

* Repeat the valid palindrome assignment from the Java section, but do it using JavascriptW

* Update your login page again:
  * Create a list of users in your javascript file
  * On the form submission do one of the following:  
    * Username and password are correct -> Show a welcome alert
    * Username is correct but password is not -> Show an invalid password alert
    * Username not found -> Show a username not found alert
  * Things to think about when validating. Do you care about case sensitivity for usernames?  How about passwords?
