* Recipe Display: Find a recipe you like and make a webpage to show off the recipe
  * Have the name and at least one image
  * Show the ingredients and the instructions
  * Use CSS to make things look nice.
* Paint color display project. Web pages need to be responsive and one tool for this is flexbox.  For this project, create a page that has a list of color options for paints.  Each option should be a box that has: a box filled in with the color, the name of the color, and the price.  The product boxes should be displayed using flexbox so that if you make the browser bigger or smaller, the content shrinks and grows and the number of products per row shrinks and grows.  
* Media query project. Create a webpage with two columns, the left one being a navigation menu and the second being content.  Add breakpoints so that at a certain size, the layout changes so that the navigation is on top and the content is on bottom in a way that looks like a single column and fits better for a mobile sized screen.
