# Java Continued

[Table of Contents](../readme.md)

This section will be assignments / mini projects for you to work through.  For each of the assignments, find the associated class in the Java folder of this repository for instructions and copy the contents into the class you create in Eclipse.  For the assignments, you can do them in the existing project you have created.  For the mini project, create new Java projects and github repositories for each one.

First we will use git for the first time.  

* Open a gitbash terminal and navigate to the workspace you created for eclipse. Some commands you will use:
  * ls -> this command will show all of the files and folders in the current directory
  * cd .. -> this command and path will navigate you to the parent of the current directory
  * cd ./child/another_child -> this command will navigate to a directory called child within this directory and   then into a directory called another_child from there
* Navigate into the project you've created within the workspace
* Go to github, sign in, on the top right you will see a + where you can click and press 'New Repository'
* Create a repository called 'Java Assignments'
* This will take you to a page with a list of commands to run inside your bash terminal starting with 'git init'
* Use each of these commands in order within git bash and see the next step for what to do when doing git push
* When it asks for your username/email and password, use the personal access token you created as your password
* Do git status and you should see all of the files you've created for the project
* Do git add . to add them to tracking
* Do commit commit -m 'some message you decide on'
* Do git push
* Refresh the repository on github and you should see your project there
