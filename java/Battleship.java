 * Battleship
 * 
 * You will recreate the board game battleship 
 * 
 * Create a 9x11 board for the computer and they will randomly place their pieces
 * Create a 9X11 board for you where you can place your pieces using row, column, and direction as input
 * 
 * Make sure:
 *  A) The pieces fit completely on the board
 *  B) The pieces don't overlap
 * 
 * The pieces are one 5 length, one 4 length, two 3 length, one 2 length.
 * 
 * Coin toss to see who goes first at which point
 * 
 * Between each guess from each person, you will see the 
 * computer's board printed out with H's for places you've hit and M's for places you guess that missed
 * and your board with the size of the ship printed in each square or an H for places hit
 *
