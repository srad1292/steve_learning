/**
 * Point of Sale
 * 
 * Create a point of sale system for an imaginary video store
 * You will want to have 
 * - A name and address for your store
 * - Ability to update said name and address
 * - An inventory system 
 * - A checkout system
 * 
 * For the inventory system you should have a base class for items in your shop
 * and then extend them into more specific things like movies, video games, snacks, etc
 * Be able to add and remove items from your inventory as well as update the count of items
 * 
 * For the checkout system
 * Make sure that items being checked out updates the inventory
 * Make sure to calculate the price (For this project, just store everything in cents)
 * 
 * This will be done using menus and standard input and no GUI.
 * Ex
 * 
 * What do you want to do?
 * 
 * 1. Update store details
 * 2. Update inventory
 * 3. Checkout a customer
 * 
 * Choice (1, 2, 3?): 
 * 
 * Or however you want to lay out the menu
