/**
 * Bank System
 * 
 * You will create a bank system where you have:
 * 
 * Bank has available funds
 * Branches of the bank
 * Employees within the branches
 * Customers who have accounts
 * Customers able to add money to accounts
 * Customers able to transfer funds from one account to another
 * Customers able to transfer money to the bank
 * Bank able to transfer money to customers
 * 
 * Should have classes at least for Bank, Branch, Employee, Customer, Account and can add more as you see fit
 * 
 * This will be done using a menu with standard input and no GUI
 * 
 * For this, you can learn about big decimal as the way to store currency in Java
 * or research and see what else may be available.
