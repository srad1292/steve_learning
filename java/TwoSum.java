/**
 * Two Sum
 * 
 * Create a method that takes in an array of numbers and a target integer
 * and then returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target
 * 
 * Assumptions:
 * There is one and exactly one solution
 * You cannot use the same index twice
 * 
 * 
 * Example
 * 
 * Input: nums = [10, 4, 8, 7, 6, 11, 2, 12] target = 9
 * Output: [3, 6]
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
 * Output: [0,1]
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
 * Output: [1,2]
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
 * Output: [0,1]
